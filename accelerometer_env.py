# Accelerometer Intergration
# Objective: Position detection with velocity derived through acceleration
# Key Components: 1) Model acceleration as measured by the Accelarometer
#                 2) Integrate Acceleration to determine velocity
# Assumptions: - Sample Measured position with 0.01km/hr^2 standard deviation
